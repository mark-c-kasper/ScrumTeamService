# Scrum Team Service

Okay, so reading this at first glance, this repo might not be named the best.
Sadly, we are not renaming it at this point; however, I always verify the name with the team before committing.
Thankfully, there is always the option to rename repos.

## Intent

The intent of this service is primarily to demonstrate my ability to write basic backend CRUD logic.
I went with a NoSQL database as to save on costs as I wouldn't need to host a running database up in AWS for any period of time.

## Nuget Packages Used

- Serilog
- Fluent Validations
- AWS DynamoDb

## Concepts Used

- Dependency Injection
- I try to typically write DRY (donot repeat yourself) code 
- Generics - (pairs with DRY)
- SOLID
